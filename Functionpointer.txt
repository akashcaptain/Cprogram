Concept Of Function Pointer :-
How to declare ptr to an array
int main(){
{  
	int *ptr[10]; // wrong its means 10 printer  pointing to integers
	return 0; // always remember precedence of operator precedence of {} is higher than *
} 
now right one is 
int (*ptr)[10];// to an array of 10 int as () >> []
So to point a function we use 
int (*ptr)(int, int) // to function contain two argument and return value int
